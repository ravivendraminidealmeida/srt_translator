1
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,983
Oh, that's beautiful.

2
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:25,852
It was terrible.
I can't do it.

3
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,555
Hmm, not yet.

4
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,023
But you will.

5
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,430
You're growing up so fast.

6
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:38,865
You say that all the time.

7
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,601
Yeah, it's because you are.

8
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:45,906
You look so much
like your sister.

9
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,780
I wish I could remember her.

10
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,056
If I come back and
you're a foot taller...

11
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,659
gonna ground you.

12
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:12,018
Shh.

13
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,054
Remember what we learned, okay?

14
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:37,911
Eve, come with me.

15
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:43,884
Stay quiet.

16
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,530
We opened our hearts to you.

17
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,132
We embraced you.

18
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,968
We let you, an outsider,

19
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,904
marry a daughter of our clan.

20
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,307
And how did you
repay this kindness?

21
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,979
You took what was
not rightfully yours.

22
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,582
And now, your wife is dead,

23
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:26,052
to atone for your
transgressions.

24
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,256
Did you think that you
could just walk away?

25
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,024
Hmm?

26
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,227
Where is she?

27
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,163
Where is Eve?

28
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,669
Charming.

29
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:51,779
You're a fucking coward.

30
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,313
You're trying to
convince yourself

31
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,183
that fate absolves
you of your actions.

32
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,786
-There are no choices.
-Yeah.

33
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,354
Does that make what
you do any easier?

34
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,024
It makes what I do...

35
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:06,293
necessary.

36
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,571
One bullet...

37
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,940
well placed...

38
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,377
can be a magical thing.

39
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:26,846
It's neither good...

40
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,015
nor evil.

41
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,319
But how a man uses it

42
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,155
reveals his true character.

43
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:40,828
You wanted choices.

44
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,263
Well, here they are.

45
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:45,332
You kill yourself,

46
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,668
and your daughter lives.

47
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,803
Or kill me,

48
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,674
and you and your
daughter die together.

49
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,746
Choice is yours.

50
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,059
You've got your choice.

51
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,462
Now, do you have
the balls to do it?

52
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,239
Papa!

53
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,670
Hey, baby, look at me.

54
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,205
It's okay.

55
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,977
Come on.

56
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:07,975
Come on.

57
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,245
Papa.

58
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,181
I'm sorry, honey.

59
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,985
-I never wanted this for you.
-Papa.

60
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:54,955
I'm sorry.

61
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,492
Papa!

62
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,328
Papa...

63
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:07,727
Tchaikovsky. How lovely.

64
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,104
At a time of loss,

65
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,506
there's nothing easier than pity

66
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,741
and nothing more
difficult than the truth,

67
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,612
as there are no easy
answers for grief.

68
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,515
I'd like to be honest with you.

69
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,684
Would that be all right?

70
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,936
Your father was a good man.

71
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,608
He wanted a free and
open life for you.

72
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,814
Not like the one that
he had to endure.

73
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:06,086
But we all live with
the decisions we make.

74
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,957
Now he's been taken from you.

75
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,660
I can do nothing about that.

76
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,130
But what I can do...

77
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,400
is offer to take
you to his family.

78
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:22,970
They will look after you

79
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,339
and, hopefully...

80
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,809
one day become your family, too.

81
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,756
The Director will see you now.

82
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,370
Does she know who her
parents really were?

83
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,053
Come here. Sit.

84
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,127
You dance, yes?

85
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:29,761
Mmm-hmm.

86
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,231
I run this theater,

87
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,202
and I am always looking
for new recruits.

88
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,041
I know you.

89
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,276
I know your pain.

90
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,247
What boils inside of
you under the surface.

91
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:52,419
I can give you somewhere
to put that anger.

92
00:15:54,187 --> 00:15:56,222
Those men took your past.

93
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,458
Don't let them
steal your future.

94
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,340
Well?

95
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:16,308
She says my path is now here

96
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,844
with the Ruska Roma.

97
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,116
Very well...

98
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:25,418
Eve.

99
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:30,356
Thank you, Mr. Winston.

100
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:33,860
You are most welcome,
Miss MaCarro.

101
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:45,004
And know that I will
always be at your service.

102
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:04,590
My name is Nogi.

103
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:05,958
Did you know my father?

104
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:07,994
I did.

105
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,535
Your father was
Ruska Roma, like me.

106
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,637
Like you will be, too.

107
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,476
He was what we call Kikimora.

108
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:25,777
What is that?

109
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,779
In Slavic mythology,

110
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,716
the Kikimora is a kind of spirit

111
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,220
to those with darkness
in their hearts.

112
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,756
She can be vengeful
and destructive.

113
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,360
Like the boogeyman?

114
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:42,628
Yes.

115
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,998
But to the innocent...

116
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:48,868
she can be a protector.

117
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:55,974
It is...

118
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,112
two sides...

119
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,914
to the one coin.

120
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,217
To kill...

121
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,022
To save.

122
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:16,263
But, ultimately...

123
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,102
it is up to you to choose.

124
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,836
Are you finished?

125
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,939
No.

126
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:34,507
Good.

127
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,343
That will be all for today.

128
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:39,845
Tend to your wounds
before you get sepsis,

129
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,913
and we have to
cut off your feet.

130
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,983
Tell Tatiana she's next.

131
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,982
"Her Majesty" says you're up.

132
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,518
That woman hates me.

133
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,388
She hates everybody.

134
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,127
Christ, Eve.

135
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,197
Why do you push
yourself like this?

136
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,000
I want to be ready.

137
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,035
Ready for what?

138
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,106
You know what's funny?

139
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,341
When I was a little girl,

140
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:44,142
I actually did want to
be a real ballerina.

141
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,112
You are a real ballerina.

142
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,848
You're the best dancer here.

143
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,751
That other shit, you'll
learn with training.

144
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,239
Fire!

145
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:17,477
One bullet,

146
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,210
well placed,

147
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,448
can change the world.

148
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:31,924
The Kikimora's purpose
is to stop that bullet.

149
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,032
Time's up!

150
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:51,343
To become Kikimora you
must become the assassin.

151
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,845
You must learn to move like him

152
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,682
and think like him.

153
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,819
For this next exercise,

154
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,055
we will be using
simulated rounds.

155
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,424
What are the rules?

156
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:08,928
Protect your ward at all costs.

157
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,331
That is the only rule.

158
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,133
Why did you fail?

159
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,234
He's too strong.

160
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,702
Do you really believe

161
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,303
that strength has anything to do

162
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,039
with whether you win or lose?

163
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,175
You will always be weaker.

164
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,480
You will always be smaller
and at a disadvantage.

165
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,549
He is beating you

166
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,916
because you are allowing him

167
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:07,319
to define the terms
of the contest.

168
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:09,255
You want to win?

169
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,027
Change the terms.

170
00:23:16,696 --> 00:23:19,732
Improvise, adapt, cheat.

171
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,402
Lean into your strengths,

172
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,071
not his.

173
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,043
Fight like a girl.

174
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,449
Begin.

175
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,321
Good.

176
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,145
Where is she?

177
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,916
Tatiana's things are gone.
Did something happen to her?

178
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,921
Sit.

179
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:58,530
Tatiana did not have
the qualities required

180
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:00,466
to continue with the Ruska Roma.

181
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,536
What are you talking about?

182
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,806
She lacked the killer
instinct I see in you.

183
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,141
Your childhood was taken.

184
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,311
This pain is what drives you.

185
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,946
Tatiana...

186
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:17,949
there is sadness, not pain.

187
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,385
There's a difference.

188
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,655
You two are now on
different paths.

189
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,625
Then why are you
holding me back?

190
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,395
I'm ready.

191
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:32,398
Perhaps you are right.

192
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:38,671
It is time.

193
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:48,414
This is the final
stage of your training.

194
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:12,905
Oh, my God.

195
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,342
Are you fucking kidding me?

196
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,111
I'm a fucking test?

197
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:22,414
How the mighty have fallen.

198
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,057
Do you know who I am?

199
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:33,559
No.

200
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:35,994
I'm you...

201
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,398
in ten fucking years.

202
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:56,041
Somehow you managed to get out,

203
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:58,544
but here you are
back where you began.

204
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,614
All of this for what?

205
00:28:21,768 --> 00:28:23,601
With this, Jardani,

206
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,304
your ticket is torn.

207
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:34,747
You can never come home again.

208
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,517
Take him to the lifeboat.

209
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,754
Do svidanya.

210
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,859
Das vedanya.

211
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:56,535
You're him.

212
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,772
The one they call the Baba Yaga.

213
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:10,416
The students all talk about you.

214
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,222
How do I get outta here?

215
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,459
The front door is unlocked.

216
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,461
No. I mean...

217
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:26,565
how do I start
doing what you do?

218
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:31,303
Looks like you already have.

219
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,706
That door will lock
sooner than you think.

220
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,109
You can still leave.

221
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,979
You still have a choice.

222
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,584
Why didn't you leave?

223
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,721
I'm working on it.

224
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,829
The Director feels you are ready

225
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,431
for your first contract.

226
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,569
You will protect this woman.

227
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,470
Katla Park.

228
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,473
Her father is our
primary charge.

229
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,009
He is concerned
that his competitors

230
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,712
may try to get to him by
ransoming his daughter.

231
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,683
Your job is to make sure
they don't get the chance.

232
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:19,918
To infiltrate past security,

233
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,689
you'll be using a modified
3D printed Glock 43X

234
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,425
with reinforced
carbon fiber barrel,

235
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:28,760
and polymer rounds.

236
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,033
Rubber bullets?

237
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:35,935
Problem?

238
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,538
-No.
-You'll find Miss Park

239
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,208
at Minus Eleven.

240
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,585
In position.

241
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,353
Copy.

242
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,922
I have the principal in sight.

243
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,859
Hold your position.

244
00:32:09,495 --> 00:32:10,495
She can dance.

245
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,942
I got movement at ten o'clock.

246
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,545
A threat?

247
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,115
Stand by.

248
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,322
Hey!

249
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:38,824
Definitely a threat.

250
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,378
You should get out of the way.

251
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:01,447
I can't.

252
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,617
I understand.

253
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,901
Hey!

254
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:41,065
No, no, no.

255
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,800
I don't want anyone
to touch me right now.

256
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:44,536
Hey, hey. It's okay.

257
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:46,517
You're safe now, it's fine.

258
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:49,040
Let's get you out of here.

259
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,427
Hey, what the hell
is goin' on up there?

260
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:50,696
Somebody respond.

261
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:18,756
Were you stuck in the elevator?

262
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,628
Yes. It was very scary.

263
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:52,678
Miss, something's
leaking from your bag.

264
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:57,447
Yes. Thank you.

265
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,550
No problem.

266
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:08,626
Is there a reason you've
brought me a severed hand?

267
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:09,695
Look at the scar.

268
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:14,165
I've seen this before.

269
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,266
That's the same scar

270
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,268
as the man who
murdered my father.

271
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,470
It was a mark from a tribe.

272
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:22,472
You knew who they were.

273
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,575
How dare you?

274
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:26,210
I have been protecting you.

275
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:29,113
Why didn't you tell
me who they were?

276
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:31,548
My child, you do not understand.

277
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,150
People with that mark,

278
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:37,154
they have no rules, no
consequence, no mercy.

279
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,989
They do not interfere
with our business,

280
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,058
and we do not
interfere with theirs.

281
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:44,561
This is a pact as old as
the Ruska Roma itself.

282
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,064
All these rules, who
are they serving?

283
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,399
When you deal in blood,

284
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,602
there must be rules...

285
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:54,071
or nothing survives.

286
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,240
Why would a tribe try
to kidnap a child?

287
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,008
I am warning you,

288
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,944
you will not find them,

289
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:02,913
and hunting for them
will only bring chaos.

290
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:05,182
I'm ordering you,

291
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,451
do not pursue this.

292
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:09,587
Do I make myself clear?

293
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,431
Please...

294
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,568
take your hand.

295
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,408
Welcome to the Continental.

296
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,976
Checking in?

297
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:09,213
No. I'd like to speak
with the manager.

298
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:11,015
Is he expecting you?

299
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:12,316
No, he's not.

300
00:44:12,317 --> 00:44:13,884
I see.

301
00:44:13,885 --> 00:44:15,520
And what, may I
ask, is your name?

302
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,688
Eve.

303
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:18,924
Eve MaCarro.

304
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:24,929
Let me see what I can do.

305
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,545
Eve MaCarro of the Ruska Roma.

306
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,349
What a pleasure
to see you again.

307
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:48,119
Please.

308
00:44:57,262 --> 00:44:58,897
So, what brings you here?

309
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:04,301
I'm looking for the tribe
that killed my father.

310
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:07,204
And if I suggested you didn't?

311
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:10,341
I would smile and nod
and then ignore you.

312
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:13,043
Ah.

313
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:15,279
The Director has already
warned me about them

314
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,114
and the rules.

315
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:18,916
So, I can appreciate
your reluctance.

316
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:20,785
That's very kind of you,

317
00:45:20,786 --> 00:45:24,889
but a few words of advice,
if I may, Miss MaCarro.

318
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:27,591
Whatever information you
think these people have,

319
00:45:27,592 --> 00:45:31,362
it might not be in your
best interests to know it.

320
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,764
I still need to know.

321
00:45:33,765 --> 00:45:36,233
"Needing to know" is
what got us banished

322
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,602
from the Garden of Eden.

323
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:42,373
Are you prepared to be
cast out again, Eve?

324
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:53,418
Please.

325
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:00,691
Very well.

326
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:07,164
I'll give you this. It's
not a tribe, it's a cult.

327
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:10,134
That kills not
just for business,

328
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,169
but for sport.

329
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,505
While we live among
so-called polite society,

330
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:16,640
they do not.

331
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:18,675
Where can I find them?

332
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:22,679
The precise location is unknown.

333
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,615
But we do monitor them when
they stay at our hotels.

334
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,717
They have access to
the Continentals?

335
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:32,056
Oh, yes. Better to have them
inside the tent, pissing out,

336
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:35,459
than outside, pissing in.

337
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,462
And, yes, there is a
man who bears that mark

338
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,365
staying at one of our
hotels at the present...

339
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:43,000
in Prague, I believe.

340
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:44,669
On what business?

341
00:46:51,276 --> 00:46:52,443
Shall we?

342
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:08,658
Hello, my dear.

343
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,194
Muriel, be a darling

344
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,762
and bring up the latest
Blackwire submissions

345
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,499
on a Daniel Pine.

346
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,403
Daniel Pine...

347
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:21,371
Contract submitted
three days ago.

348
00:47:21,372 --> 00:47:23,340
His bounty is set
at two million.

349
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,542
He's currently holed up inside
the Prague Continental...

350
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:27,879
room 3-1-5.

351
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,182
No outside calls
have been logged,

352
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:35,786
and he's purchased a
shitload of room service.

353
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,622
Mostly ice cream.

354
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:39,790
Sweet tooth, hmm?

355
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,791
Hard copy, please.

356
00:47:54,973 --> 00:47:55,974
Sir...

357
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:57,976
there is a call for you.

358
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,245
From The Director.

359
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:12,717
Checking in.

360
00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:14,551
Certainly.

361
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:17,054
And how long will you
be staying with us?

362
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,256
Just the night.

363
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:22,827
Room 314, please.

364
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,651
Still no movement from Pine.

365
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,486
What are my orders?

366
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,155
Keep your eyes on Pine.

367
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:52,457
We may have a taker.

368
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,939
You're right.

369
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,176
We have a taker.

370
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,845
A woman, young, dark hair.

371
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:19,484
She's in.

372
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,610
Who are you?

373
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:50,880
Shit.

374
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,050
You're not supposed
to say that word.

375
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:56,487
Right. Sorry.

376
00:50:57,522 --> 00:50:59,657
-What's your name?
-Ella.

377
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,891
I'm Eve.

378
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,229
You're not here to
hurt my daddy, are you?

379
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:07,732
Your father?

380
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:25,081
Ella, come here.

381
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,350
Everything's gonna be all right.

382
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:28,191
Why don't you come stand
behind me, sweetheart?

383
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:33,958
What do you want?

384
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:37,661
When I was a child,

385
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:39,964
men with your mark
murdered my father.

386
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:43,067
I just want to know
where to find them.

387
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:49,307
You have no idea what you
just walked into, do you?

388
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,482
No business being conducted.

389
00:51:58,249 --> 00:51:59,317
They're just talking.

390
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:07,658
Contract services.

391
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:09,659
How can I help you?

392
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,962
Account 8-6-5-1.

393
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:13,964
Name on contract?

394
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,667
Daniel Pine.

395
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:20,070
Double the contract.

396
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,367
Fuck.

397
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,537
You just made everything
a whole lot worse.

398
00:52:53,538 --> 00:52:55,572
Those people that
you're looking for?

399
00:52:55,573 --> 00:52:58,007
They're surrounding
this hotel right now,

400
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,077
hoping somebody breaks the
rules and takes the bait.

401
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:03,880
I think they were hoping that
somebody was gonna be you.

402
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,354
Now, you've just made 'em antsy.

403
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:17,294
Why would they be at the hotel?

404
00:53:17,295 --> 00:53:18,735
They just want me
dead to get to her.

405
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,514
Baby, stay down!

406
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,164
Ella, come on.

407
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,071
Come on.

408
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,511
He's moving. Hallway.

409
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,881
Damn it!

410
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:46,115
Come on.

411
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,158
Back, back, back
the other way. Go!

412
00:54:55,693 --> 00:54:56,994
Wait, wait. Get behind me.

413
00:54:58,062 --> 00:54:59,129
Come on.

414
00:55:40,505 --> 00:55:41,506
Ella, honey...

415
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,073
let's go.

416
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:51,949
Why do they want her?

417
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:53,984
It's a cult.

418
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:55,953
No one gets out.

419
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:57,788
Ever.

420
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,729
You gotta help me
get Ella outta here.

421
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,464
She deserves a better
life than this.

422
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:09,033
I can't. That's
not why I'm here.

423
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,301
You're Kikimora.

424
00:56:12,169 --> 00:56:13,337
Isn't that what you do?

425
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:16,072
Help me protect her.

426
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:17,642
I'll tell you
where to find them.

427
00:56:20,144 --> 00:56:21,145
Please?

428
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:23,514
Daddy...

429
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,450
are we going to die?

430
00:56:26,451 --> 00:56:27,751
No.

431
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:28,819
No, baby.

432
00:56:29,487 --> 00:56:30,588
No, not today.

433
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,725
You can trust her.

434
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:16,400
-Hi.
-Huh?

435
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:21,806
It's okay.

436
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,612
-Hey.
-How many left?

437
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:29,979
Two. Maybe ten.

438
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,881
Oh, fuck it.

439
00:57:55,873 --> 00:57:58,342
Daddy!

440
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:55,833
Yes?

441
00:58:56,634 --> 00:58:57,702
We have the girl.

442
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:00,369
Good.

443
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,372
Sir, there was
someone else there.

444
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:04,708
Who?

445
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:05,876
A woman.

446
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:08,544
For the contract?

447
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,813
I don't think so.

448
00:59:09,814 --> 00:59:11,881
I think she might
have been after Ella.

449
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:12,917
Really?

450
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,853
Do we, uh...

451
00:59:17,054 --> 00:59:18,622
Do we know who she is?

452
00:59:18,623 --> 00:59:19,789
Not yet.

453
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:22,226
I left her for
Continental security.

454
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:34,872
They started this.

455
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,774
That's bullshit.

456
00:59:38,308 --> 00:59:40,044
I did not break any rules.

457
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,014
-You broke my fuckin' jaw.
-You're still using it.

458
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,517
I didn't kill anyone.

459
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:00,430
You're going to
need to check out.

460
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,332
Understood.

461
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:28,177
And what will it
be today, madam?

462
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:33,430
I'd like to go hunting.

463
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,568
Have you ever done
business with these people?

464
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,405
I have not.

465
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:46,375
But you know of them.

466
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:48,645
You know more than
me, I assure you.

467
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:51,816
May I be "frank"?

468
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:54,919
Mmm-hmm.

469
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:57,654
I prefer to keep it that way.

470
01:00:58,956 --> 01:01:00,056
Hmm.

471
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:01,725
Are we just window
shopping today,

472
01:01:01,726 --> 01:01:03,593
or would you like
to make a purchase?

473
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,463
Depends on the merchandise.

474
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:20,377
After you, madam.

475
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,190
Pardon me.

476
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:39,528
So...

477
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,132
will this be a large
or small game hunt?

478
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:45,669
Large.

479
01:01:47,171 --> 01:01:49,773
The V Seven Harbinger TTI.

480
01:01:49,774 --> 01:01:51,240
Thirty rounds of .308.

481
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:54,443
It's got a Trijicon AccuPoint
1-to-6 optical on top,

482
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:57,613
and in case you wanna get up
close and make it personal,

483
01:01:57,614 --> 01:02:01,117
you've got a side RMR for
the faster, dirtier stuff.

484
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:04,420
TTI custom Benelli
M2 21-inch fin grip.

485
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:08,257
Oversized charging handle,
oversized bolt release.

486
01:02:08,258 --> 01:02:09,538
This will take a
bear's head off.

487
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:10,995
Easily.

488
01:02:13,998 --> 01:02:16,065
Oh, this is a personal
favorite of mine.

489
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:18,202
This...

490
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:29,178
Ah! Fuck!

491
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:30,247
Bastards! Fuck!

492
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:24,554
Motherfuckers.

493
01:05:29,093 --> 01:05:30,859
All right...

494
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,429
you didn't hear this from me.

495
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:40,203
Their precise location
has never been confirmed,

496
01:05:40,204 --> 01:05:41,971
since anyone who's
ever gone looking

497
01:05:41,972 --> 01:05:43,373
has also gone missing.

498
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:45,242
That's bad math.

499
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:47,043
However,

500
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:48,677
whispers suggest they've
been known to gather

501
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,346
somewhere in these peaks,

502
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:53,250
deep in the mountains
past Abersee and Feldkirk.

503
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:55,384
It's not much.

504
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:57,087
It's more than I had.

505
01:05:57,854 --> 01:05:58,854
Thank you.

506
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:03,260
Sorry about your shop.

507
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,232
I need a car.

508
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,091
Did you think I
would not find out?

509
01:07:08,092 --> 01:07:10,593
That you expressly
disobeyed my orders?

510
01:07:10,594 --> 01:07:12,061
Then tell me who they are.

511
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:14,363
I told you, we do
not engage with them.

512
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:17,600
You risk the destruction of
our family, and for what?

513
01:07:17,601 --> 01:07:19,268
Your own selfish reasons.

514
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:22,339
Return at once or I
will have no choice.

515
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:46,490
Can I get you anything?

516
01:08:51,861 --> 01:08:53,096
Just a coffee.

517
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,775
Come, let's go.

518
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,453
It's Agnetha!

519
01:10:24,454 --> 01:10:26,055
Send somebody to the restaurant!

520
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:27,491
Hurry!

521
01:11:15,672 --> 01:11:16,806
Go around the back.

522
01:11:17,741 --> 01:11:18,941
Don't let her escape!

523
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:37,827
I'm not gonna hurt you.

524
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:36,886
The fuck?

525
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,307
Chancellor, this is The Eye.

526
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,210
What is it?

527
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:44,447
The outsider has
not been contained.

528
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,483
Engage full protocols.

529
01:16:10,133 --> 01:16:11,133
Find her!

530
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,070
Ah.

531
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:23,907
You're having a
little tea party.

532
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:30,579
Aren't you going to say
hello to your grandfather?

533
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:32,580
Where is Daddy?

534
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:33,817
Is he okay?

535
01:17:37,053 --> 01:17:40,923
You have no idea, Ella,
how worried I was.

536
01:17:40,924 --> 01:17:41,991
All of us.

537
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,865
Your father...

538
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:53,068
well, he broke our customs.

539
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:54,971
He was trying to take you away.

540
01:17:55,772 --> 01:17:57,740
Away from me.

541
01:17:57,741 --> 01:17:59,308
Away from your family.

542
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:01,310
I hate you.

543
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:06,749
That hate will make
you strong, Ella.

544
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,351
I hate you.

545
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:12,488
Chancellor.

546
01:18:17,994 --> 01:18:19,062
We got her.

547
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:21,197
Is she dead?

548
01:18:22,966 --> 01:18:24,133
She's Ruska Roma.

549
01:18:24,768 --> 01:18:26,335
She has their mark.

550
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,602
You know, I met
your Director once.

551
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:02,438
It was many years ago in Moscow.

552
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:06,108
Not a very pleasant lady.

553
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:11,013
But we did have a respectful
conversation, nonetheless.

554
01:19:11,014 --> 01:19:15,450
A shared understanding of the
roles that we both play...

555
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:18,586
and, more importantly, the
roles that we don't play.

556
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:20,488
The Director didn't
send me here.

557
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,425
The Ruska Roma has
nothing to do with this.

558
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,261
Well, it does now.

559
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:34,169
Why are you here?

560
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:38,474
If you've come for the girl,
you are gravely mistaken.

561
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:41,543
Ella is my granddaughter.

562
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:44,881
Someday, all of
this will be hers.

563
01:19:45,381 --> 01:19:46,749
My son,

564
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,017
well...

565
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:51,955
he tried to deprive her
of her true heritage.

566
01:19:53,089 --> 01:19:55,558
You put a contract
on your own son?

567
01:19:57,226 --> 01:19:59,194
You may have noticed
we don't take well

568
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:00,997
to outsiders
meddling in our town.

569
01:20:02,698 --> 01:20:06,669
This is where people like
yourself come to live,

570
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:09,338
to have real lives.

571
01:20:10,273 --> 01:20:12,175
To raise families.

572
01:20:14,978 --> 01:20:17,780
Would you not like to someday

573
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:20,249
have a family of your own?

574
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,417
I had a family!

575
01:20:22,418 --> 01:20:24,186
I was a child.

576
01:20:24,187 --> 01:20:27,389
Men came into my house.
Men from your tribe.

577
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:28,556
Ah.

578
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:29,625
I see.

579
01:20:31,127 --> 01:20:32,995
This is about vengeance.

580
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:34,729
They killed my father

581
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,365
and tried to take me.

582
01:20:39,903 --> 01:20:41,204
Tried to take you?

583
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:52,715
Fate is a very humbling thing.

584
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:14,602
What is it?

585
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:17,706
Well, she... she wasn't
working for Pine.

586
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:22,377
She's here because
I killed her father

587
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,913
when she was a child.

588
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:28,051
She's your sister.

589
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:31,486
No.

590
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:33,856
For God's sake!

591
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:43,532
What are you doing?

592
01:21:47,136 --> 01:21:48,136
Lena!

593
01:22:38,754 --> 01:22:40,789
All this time, I
thought you were dead.

594
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:43,826
What are you talkin' about?

595
01:22:48,097 --> 01:22:49,832
You don't remember me, do you?

596
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:55,138
You were born here, Eve.

597
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:57,640
We both were.

598
01:22:59,775 --> 01:23:02,345
My little sister has come home.

599
01:23:05,881 --> 01:23:07,850
When I was younger,
I used to wonder...

600
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:12,387
"Why did he take
you and not me?"

601
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:15,990
I mean, later I realized
it was too late for me.

602
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:17,626
I'd already taken a life.

603
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:20,829
But you...

604
01:23:23,132 --> 01:23:24,832
He thought he could raise you

605
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,601
with no memory of this place,

606
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,371
of your true home.

607
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,818
But I guess it never
leaves your blood, does it?

608
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:33,642
In the end,

609
01:23:34,610 --> 01:23:36,010
we are who we are.

610
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,313
We are not the same.

611
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:40,383
Your people...

612
01:23:41,784 --> 01:23:43,118
killed my father.

613
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:44,386
Our father. Yes.

614
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:45,887
For betraying us.

615
01:23:45,888 --> 01:23:49,391
And then our mother
had to pay the price.

616
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:51,627
The Chancellor was trying
to save you that night.

617
01:23:52,928 --> 01:23:54,262
He was trying to
bring you back home,

618
01:23:54,263 --> 01:23:55,530
as he would with anyone.

619
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:58,233
My father was trying to
give me a normal life!

620
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,803
Well, he would be very proud.

621
01:24:01,804 --> 01:24:03,138
You're forcing children
into this life!

622
01:24:03,139 --> 01:24:05,107
As Ruska Roma has with you.

623
01:24:05,108 --> 01:24:06,441
No!

624
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:08,776
She gave me a
choice! I chose this!

625
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:09,878
Oh, did you?

626
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,350
Or did fate just find
another path for you?

627
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:24,327
At least here we're
honest about who we are.

628
01:24:25,294 --> 01:24:26,895
No Kikimora lies.

629
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:32,401
We've got eyes on her.

630
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:35,904
Cabin 83.

631
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:40,909
She's inside with
Lena, sir, talking.

632
01:24:44,513 --> 01:24:45,681
Take them out.

633
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:47,583
Sir?

634
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,121
Kill them both.

635
01:24:57,726 --> 01:24:59,595
You heard The
Chancellor. Blow it.

636
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:45,241
I was only nine when they
told us you were dead.

637
01:25:46,108 --> 01:25:47,276
Save your breath.

638
01:25:50,413 --> 01:25:51,947
I missed you.

639
01:26:10,766 --> 01:26:11,967
Everyone, move in.

640
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,679
Check for survivors.

641
01:26:56,445 --> 01:26:58,112
Strike team...

642
01:26:58,113 --> 01:27:00,549
Strike team, do you copy?

643
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,255
Is it done?

644
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,000
This isn't done
until you're dead.

645
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:34,349
Yes?

646
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:37,353
We have a problem, you and I.

647
01:27:39,021 --> 01:27:41,088
And what problem might that be?

648
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,624
That a member of your tribe

649
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:45,693
has contravened a
centuries old truce.

650
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:49,097
The Ruska Roma have
no desire for a war.

651
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:53,134
Especially not with you.

652
01:27:53,135 --> 01:27:54,602
Whether you sent her or not

653
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:56,438
is of no interest to me.

654
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,306
You will accept
full consequences

655
01:27:58,307 --> 01:27:59,541
of her actions.

656
01:27:59,542 --> 01:28:01,008
Which are?

657
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:02,944
The end of your tribe.

658
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:05,881
Your students, your
fucking pets, everything.

659
01:28:06,849 --> 01:28:09,150
Call her off.

660
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:11,319
Chancellor, she's operating

661
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,988
against Ruska Roma.

662
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:16,459
I could not call
her off if I tried.

663
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:20,162
Then war it shall be.

664
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,199
Perhaps an agreement
could be struck.

665
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,636
I can send someone
to solve the problem.

666
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:30,638
Someone capable.

667
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:31,974
No more bloodshed.

668
01:28:33,108 --> 01:28:34,742
If you agree to this,

669
01:28:34,743 --> 01:28:38,880
you must also agree that
your men will not engage.

670
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:41,549
If come midnight
she still breathes,

671
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:44,987
retaliation will be
inevitable and total.

672
01:28:46,088 --> 01:28:49,424
And if the problem
is taken care of?

673
01:28:49,425 --> 01:28:53,929
Then I will reconsider
my response.

674
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,432
Very well.

675
01:28:57,433 --> 01:28:59,835
I will, of course,
need your location.

676
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:05,107
A secret I assure
you will die with me.

677
01:29:12,915 --> 01:29:15,750
Madam, she is family.

678
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:17,620
She has made her choice.

679
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:22,785
The Baba Yaga.

680
01:30:31,326 --> 01:30:34,095
Citizens of Hallstatt...

681
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:38,366
this order stays in effect
until the bells ring out.

682
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:43,170
As of now, you do not engage.

683
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:46,307
Anyone who feels compelled
to go against this order

684
01:30:46,308 --> 01:30:47,743
will be cast out.

685
01:30:49,044 --> 01:30:51,446
Leave the wolf to its prey.

686
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,641
She sent you here to kill me?

687
01:31:54,577 --> 01:31:56,011
That's up to you.

688
01:31:57,746 --> 01:31:58,746
Or you can leave.

689
01:32:01,316 --> 01:32:02,317
Your choice.

690
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:09,024
Do you remember me?

691
01:32:10,826 --> 01:32:11,894
From the theater?

692
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:17,032
Remember what you said to me?

693
01:32:18,601 --> 01:32:20,702
You told me I could leave,

694
01:32:20,703 --> 01:32:22,004
that it was my choice.

695
01:32:25,107 --> 01:32:26,642
It still is.

696
01:32:37,786 --> 01:32:39,154
I'm not leaving.

697
01:32:53,802 --> 01:32:55,771
You don't have to do this.

698
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:20,028
Just leave.

699
01:33:35,778 --> 01:33:36,812
Leave.

700
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,818
Just... go.

701
01:34:21,423 --> 01:34:22,858
He killed my father.

702
01:34:24,626 --> 01:34:25,861
I know.

703
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:35,037
Let me finish this.

704
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:48,450
Midnight.

705
01:34:49,752 --> 01:34:51,553
If it isn't done...

706
01:34:53,856 --> 01:34:54,857
Rules.

707
01:34:56,992 --> 01:34:59,061
And consequences.

708
01:36:25,814 --> 01:36:29,516
Sir, he's let her go
and she's on the attack.

709
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:31,920
I recommend we re-engage
full protocols.

710
01:36:37,392 --> 01:36:38,792
Attention.

711
01:36:38,793 --> 01:36:42,064
Every citizen is now being
called to hunt the outsider.

712
01:36:47,202 --> 01:36:48,236
Let's go.

713
01:36:55,743 --> 01:36:56,845
Let's move it, move it!

714
01:36:59,281 --> 01:37:00,448
Check the boathouse.

715
01:37:03,952 --> 01:37:04,953
You see anything?

716
01:38:39,714 --> 01:38:40,747
She's here!

717
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:42,117
Hurry up! With me.

718
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,518
Be on alert.

719
01:38:44,519 --> 01:38:46,021
Make sure everything is clear.

720
01:39:41,043 --> 01:39:42,043
Cool.

721
01:39:43,345 --> 01:39:44,411
Attention.

722
01:39:44,412 --> 01:39:47,381
The outsider has
entered the armory.

723
01:39:47,382 --> 01:39:49,784
All teams proceed to the armory.

724
01:39:51,453 --> 01:39:52,654
She wants me...

725
01:39:54,289 --> 01:39:55,290
and she wants Ella.

726
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:57,858
Orders?

727
01:39:57,859 --> 01:39:59,261
You find her...

728
01:40:00,462 --> 01:40:02,664
and you destroy her.

729
01:40:04,799 --> 01:40:05,866
Come on.

730
01:40:05,867 --> 01:40:07,168
Keep your eyes open.

731
01:40:07,169 --> 01:40:09,070
Two men down at the
armory entrance.

732
01:40:09,071 --> 01:40:11,605
I repeat, two men down
at the armory entrance.

733
01:40:11,606 --> 01:40:12,974
Hold there. Hold.

734
01:40:20,415 --> 01:40:21,483
Go! Go!

735
01:40:33,528 --> 01:40:35,196
Requesting all citizens

736
01:40:35,197 --> 01:40:36,897
to the tunnels immediately.

737
01:40:36,898 --> 01:40:39,300
All citizens proceed
to the tunnels.

738
01:40:39,301 --> 01:40:41,336
Move in. I got your six.

739
01:40:59,521 --> 01:41:01,756
Oh, shit.

740
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:43,764
Over there!

741
01:42:30,545 --> 01:42:31,846
Go, go!

742
01:43:56,331 --> 01:43:57,331
She's there!

743
01:44:25,993 --> 01:44:28,028
We have lost sight
of the outsider.

744
01:44:28,029 --> 01:44:30,096
All teams be on alert.

745
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:33,199
Continue to patrol
the perimeter.

746
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,169
We're on the square. Eye,
report back. Report back.

747
01:44:36,170 --> 01:44:37,439
We're on the square.

748
01:44:47,181 --> 01:44:49,283
Alpha Team, halt!

749
01:44:51,553 --> 01:44:52,853
She has exited the tunnels.

750
01:44:52,854 --> 01:44:53,921
Check behind you.

751
01:45:38,332 --> 01:45:40,001
Sir.

752
01:45:41,803 --> 01:45:43,805
In the interest of
Hallstatt's survival,

753
01:45:44,939 --> 01:45:47,240
it would be best
to relocate you.

754
01:45:47,241 --> 01:45:50,411
In 200 years, no
leader of Hallstatt

755
01:45:50,412 --> 01:45:52,413
has ever left the seat of power

756
01:45:52,414 --> 01:45:54,215
to seek shelter.

757
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:57,283
I understand.

758
01:45:57,284 --> 01:46:00,455
But, sir, we've also
lost track of John Wick.

759
01:46:06,928 --> 01:46:08,162
Let go!

760
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:10,565
Let go of me.

761
01:48:26,968 --> 01:48:28,836
Attention. Requesting
all citizens...

762
01:49:16,984 --> 01:49:19,252
This is suicide. It's
fucking John Wick.

763
01:49:19,253 --> 01:49:20,655
Come on. He's only one man.

764
01:49:35,837 --> 01:49:37,238
Cut across here.

765
01:50:31,025 --> 01:50:32,593
Don't you think
we've had enough?

766
01:50:35,730 --> 01:50:39,199
Do you really think you're
going to save her from me?

767
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,300
From...

768
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:41,568
From all of this?

769
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:45,940
Whatever happens here...

770
01:50:47,074 --> 01:50:49,476
nothing is going to change.

771
01:50:51,545 --> 01:50:53,379
The village will remain,

772
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:55,181
the children will be raised,

773
01:50:55,182 --> 01:50:58,084
and the system will
continue as it has

774
01:50:58,085 --> 01:50:59,921
for the last thousand years.

775
01:51:00,822 --> 01:51:02,889
Look at you.

776
01:51:02,890 --> 01:51:05,358
You know that you don't
choose to be a killer,

777
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:06,794
you are chosen.

778
01:51:07,929 --> 01:51:11,031
Just like your
sister was chosen.

779
01:51:11,032 --> 01:51:13,034
Just like Ella has been chosen.

780
01:51:14,802 --> 01:51:17,203
It is your fate

781
01:51:17,204 --> 01:51:19,840
and you cannot change it.

782
01:51:19,841 --> 01:51:21,709
The only person you're
fighting is yourself...

783
01:52:10,892 --> 01:52:11,893
It's okay.

784
01:52:15,696 --> 01:52:16,697
Let's go.

785
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,665
Hmm?

786
01:52:31,678 --> 01:52:33,246
Jardani?

787
01:52:38,485 --> 01:52:40,254
So, she is dead?

788
01:52:42,023 --> 01:52:43,357
He is dead.

789
01:52:50,064 --> 01:52:51,065
Fine.

790
01:53:25,699 --> 01:53:26,968
Daddy?

791
01:53:34,708 --> 01:53:35,708
Hey, sweetie.

792
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:39,646
Come here.

793
01:53:40,982 --> 01:53:41,983
Get up here.

794
01:53:49,256 --> 01:53:50,791
Room 814.

795
01:53:51,993 --> 01:53:54,295
I trust the talk went well?

796
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:57,431
Checking in, hmm?

797
01:53:58,499 --> 01:53:59,500
Yes.

798
01:54:00,634 --> 01:54:03,004
Safe haven, Miss MaCarro.

799
01:54:05,272 --> 01:54:07,773
You may have cut
the snake's head,

800
01:54:07,774 --> 01:54:10,644
but the body still lives.

801
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:14,514
They'll be looking for you.

802
01:54:52,519 --> 01:54:54,988
Contract services.
How may I help you?

803
01:54:54,989 --> 01:54:56,390
